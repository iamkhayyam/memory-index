# The RAM Index — Memory Price as a Recession Signal

> A supply-side alternative to the Lipstick, Hemline, Men's Underwear, and Buttered Popcorn indices.

This project proposes **the RAM Index** — year-on-year change in the three-firm DRAM oligopoly's average selling price per gigabyte — as a cleaner, earlier, structurally grounded substitute for the consumer-behaviour folk indices that financial journalism has used for a century. We reconstruct the series annually for 1980–2026, compare it against the four incumbent indices across all six NBER-dated US recessions, and package the whole thing three ways: two LaTeX manuscripts and one interactive dashboard.

## The argument in one paragraph

Informal economic indicators — lipstick, hemlines, underwear, popcorn — exist because real macro data used to be slow. Each is anchored in consumer folk-psychology and each has failed at least one of the last two cycles: the Lipstick Index collapsed under COVID-era mask mandates, the Hemline Index lags the economy by three years (van Baardwijk & Franses 2010), the Men's Underwear Index has a 2-cycle track record, and the Buttered Popcorn Index was structurally broken by streaming. DRAM is the opposite kind of signal: an oligopoly-priced commodity whose ASP swings by orders of magnitude each cycle, whose decisions are made 18 months ahead of shipment, and whose macro weight is *rising* as AI capex eclipses consumer PC demand. The RAM Index catches all six NBER recessions since 1980; no folk index catches more than three.

## Quickstart

### 1. View the living dashboard

```bash
open memory-index/dashboard/index.html
```

Zero dependencies. Pure HTML + Chart.js via CDN. Toggle series, toggle recession shading, live Pearson correlations.

### 2. Build the arXiv paper

```bash
cd memory-index/paper-arxiv
pdflatex main && bibtex main && pdflatex main && pdflatex main
```

### 3. Build the Nature-style paper

```bash
cd memory-index/paper-nature
pdflatex main && bibtex main && pdflatex main && pdflatex main
```

The Nature file uses Springer Nature's `sn-jnl.cls`. If the class isn't installed, uncomment the two fallback lines at the top of `main.tex` to compile as a plain `article`.

## Contributing / extending

- Update `data/indices-wide.csv` with new quarters as they become available.
- The dashboard reads the data inline from the bottom of `dashboard/index.html`; keep the two in sync.
- A natural next step is a **Memory Complex Index** that blends DRAM, NAND, and HBM in capacity-weighted shares — the HBM share is now the most AI-sensitive sub-signal.
